<p><strong>Cosrx Blemish Cover Cushion Review</strong>. I still use a lot of their skincare products in my daily regimine like the One Step Moisture Up Pads every morning and the Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence every night. Both these shades arent too bright which I can appreciate. It can look cakey if you apply too much or if you have dry patches so I wouldnt recommend this for dry skin unless you moisturize well before applying this cushion. Blemish Cover Cushion provides buildable light to medium coverage to help even complexion and hide spots while u sing proven blemish-fighting ingredients like tea tree oil and Centella asiatica to help treat acne-prone skin.</p>
